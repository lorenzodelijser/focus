# Focus for Google Docs

![Focus for Google Docs Chrome Extension](_img/screenshot.png)

Focus for Google Docs helps you write better documents by focusing on what matters most. Bring focus to your writing, distraction free without compromises. This extension provides a minimal user interface for Google Docs inspired by iA Writer, Dropbox Paper and Ulysses.

This extension works best when you disable the _"Print Layout"_ option in _"View"_, this ensures texts will flow as intended, without page breaks.

## How to Install in Developer Mode:

### On GitHub

1. Click on `Clone or Download` and `Download ZIP`.
2. The next step is to unzip the download.
